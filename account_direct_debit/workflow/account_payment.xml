            Transition to undo the payment order and reset to
            sent, triggered by
            cancelling a bank transaction with which the order
            was reconciled.
            For this, we need to cancel the flow stop on the done state,
            unfortunately.
            TODO: what is below is not enough. We need to inject
            another state, 'sent_wait' between sent and done.
